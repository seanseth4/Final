							we discussed dealt with invasion of privacy matters. In the assignment, I used noise reduction tools as
							best I could to mute out as much background noise as I could, and I also added quiet music in the

								In my assignment, I discussed browser cookies. I defined what they are and what they do, and then

								can protect yourself and your information, and use it safely. When I started the assignment, I researched
								first and gathered my sources, and then I wrote a script making sure it would fit the time slots.

						Project 2 was my chance to learn what makes up a good video and how to create one myself.
						First came writing a script. I made sure to outline each section of my script and constantly
						altered it until it fit within the timeframe. I would practice recording myself and memorized my 
						script so my eyes wouldn't be darting back and forth reading it while I recorded the final draft. <br>
						When it came to filming, my setup was very basic. All I had at my disposal was my laptop and phone, and to guaruntee the
						best quality, I used many applications such as Adobe Rush, and Viva Video. Thanks to these applications,
						I was able to alter the video quality to make it look as nice as possible, add transitions, add text,
						and insert a video within a video.

						Visual effects are very powerful in how they have the ability to enhance visuals and even messages. In
						my experience with this assignment, using Adobe After Effects was challenging but was certainly fun.
						I tried to follow one tutorial and it was a little too hard for me, so I chose another and created the
						"fire" effect. To create the effect, I used a total of 4 layers, and I had to toggle the settings 
						(such as the birth size, resistance, etc) and positioning of all of them to create the movement. There is 
						no "setting" necessarily to create the appearance of fire, so what was done was using a variety of fast moving
						particles. I added the turbulant displace effect
						to make it move even more randomly (like fire does), and then used color correction properties to give it it's
						final appearance.

							According to studies that have been done, I learned that gaming can be used to solve world problems, like hunger, 
							homelessness, etc. When playing games, gamers tend to have extreme concentration and hopefulness; the goal that 
							researchers in this field have is to transfer that motivation into real life. For example, in a story-based game, each mission
							given to a player is given when they have the skillset to achieve it. This lets gamers feel motivated because they know they can
							accomplish something. Meanwhile in real life, sometimes we are given tasks that we may or may not be able to accomplish, which 
							leaves us feeling discouraged, and the goal is to change that. Gamers are getting good at urgent optimism (urge to act immediately to solve something), social fabric (bonding), blissful
							productivity (motivation to work hard), and desire for epic meaning (gamers enjoy working towards a big goal like saving the world), making them super-empowered
							hopeful individuals. Gamers believe they can change an online world in their games, and the goal is to move that inspiration
							to real life. Ever since studies have been made on this, games have been developed to actually have real-world effects,
							such as an online game called "World Without Oil", that teaches you skill sets that can help you in real life
							with saving money, and having healthier habits that will help the environment.

						<h4 class="subheading">Deepfakes</h4>
						<p>
							Deepfakes have pros and cons depending on how they're used. When it comes to the pros, using deepfakes
							can help enhance education, by creating models of past figures, like Albert Einstein, and have him teach
							the theory of relativity. This could make educational environments more engaging and fun for students, which
							is great! Unfortunately, when dealing with deepfakes, there is a lot of repsonsibility because it can be easily
							misused as well. Deepfakes can and have been used to impersonate people, especially political figures and other popular social
							figures, and have them say things they haven't. It is hard for the average person to identify if what video they're 
							watching is fake or not, so this is incredibly detrimental in the spreading of false information and can unjustly
							change the perception of people. Not only that, but any person, celebrity or not, can be targeted, such as random girls
							getting their selfies stolen and used on deepfake porn moodels. While there are pros and cons, as of right now, the
							negatives of deepfakes seem to be more popular and in use.

							<h4 class="subheading">AR/VR</h4>
							<p>
								The future and even the present of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology is incredibly promising.
								AR and VR allow the spreading of information in more accessible ways and more interactive ways. For example, VR technology
								can be used in educational environments like a chem lab, and students can conduct their experiments virtually instead, which
								would save them money on having to buy equipment to actually conduct the experiment in real life. AR and VR can also be used
								to conduct real life training scenarios for people in professions like fire fighter training, etc, or surgeons can use VR
								to simulate a surgery before performing it, to guarentee it's success. There are so many other
								uses of AR and VR that can have many benefits, and even can be used just for fun and enhancing gaming experiences. Overall,
								AR and VR technology is definietly useful for humanity.

							For our blog assignment, it dictated that we had to write about a digital concept we learned,
							a social one, and a digital media topic we would like added to the course. I decided that I would 
							talk about capturing and editing digital audio, and deepfakes because those lessons are what stuck 
							out to me the most. In the audio modules, I learned new skills in splicing and cutting audio and 
							removing background noise, which I can certainly see helping me in the future. As for deepfakes, 
							the module on it taught me a lot about the topic so I could be knowledgable on its potential benefits
							and dangers. Lasting, the digital media topic I wrote about would be social hacking, and why I think it's
							important to learn about. For all these sections, I have written much more in depth about it on my blog.
